## Skills

### Personal Skills

#### Management

In my current job I lead a team that works on both research and development as well as ensuring timely deliverables to customers. This has involved leading meetings, setting and monitoring deadlines, deciding priorities for workloads, and meeting with customers.

#### Working in a team
                    
I have worked on projects on my own and as part of a team, and I definitely enjoy the later. I am personable, friendly and have on many occasions seen that talking through ideas in a group leads to better end results.

#### Communication

I have given a variety of presentations to a wide range of audiences, a number of which involved speaking about technical subjects with a non-technical audience.


### High Performance Computing

#### CUDA

I have created and deployed large scale genetic algorithm computations on GPUs through the CUDA environment. This involved consideration of architecture and utilising different memory types to achieve a 308x speed-up over a comparable CPU solution.
* Experience: 2 years

#### Monte-Carlo Simulations

My largest Monte-Carlo simulation to date was in calculating the statistics of light in a media due to roughness at its surface, which was investigated using the university of Nottingham's high performance computing (hpc) clusters. As well as running the several million individual processes, the results had to be collated, transferred, analysed and visualized.
* Experience: 3 years

#### Large data sets

I have worked on a number of larger data projects, both in absolute size of data and incoming data rates. A recent project involved the collect of large amounts of continuous streaming data, which was then pre-processed and stored in an append-only amenable manner. Visualizing results from large data sets has been a particularly interesting challenge.
* Experience: 3 years


### Mathematics

#### Mathematica

Mathematica was, for a number of years, my day-to-day programming environment. I have wide ranging experience with Mathematica, including image processing, prototyping code, multi-core deployment, data visualisation and data-mining
* Experience: 5+ years
            
#### Matlab

Experience with Matlab centers around multi-dimensional-scaling, the problem of determining a collection of objects' positions when given only the distances between them
* Experience: 2 years


### Programming

#### Javascript/Node.js

I have built several large javascript applications and node.js is my default scripting language. Projects have ranged from a ray-optics demonstration, that is now used by the University of Nottingham, to image encoding and numerous GUI control systems for different projects. I try to stay up to date with the newest additions to the language, e.g. ES6/7 additions, and have experience with jQuery, angular, Q, RxJS and most common frameworks and libraries.
* Experience: 7 years

#### C/C++

C and C++ have been my main high-performance languages for the last 10 years, I have experience using the GNU debugger, optimizing code, and using numerical libraries such as the GNU software library
* Experience: 10+ years

#### Python

I have used python for a number of years building some larger-scale programs and for code prototyping. 
* Experience: 5+ years

#### Databases

Knowledge of SQL language including database design, UML, recursion, as well as some NoSQL solutions and where they might be appropriate. The main databases engines I have experience with are PostgreSQL, Redis and Cassandra, although I have also worked with map/reduce systems such as CouchDB.
* Experience: 5 years.

#### Haskell

Haskell is a recent addition to this cv, however in grappling with some of its fundamental concepts it has altered the way I approach some code problems, for example chaining of map/bind/reduce, the advantages of immutable data and seeing monads everywhere.
* Experience: 2 years

#### Others

Other languages I have had experience with: Java, C#, Perl, Fortran, PHP and Bash script.

#### OSes

I have experience programing in all three major OS's: Linux (10+ years), Mac (4 years) and Windows (10+ years). Both my work and home computers run linux as their primary OS, centOS and fedora respectively. I have set up several servers and am competent at both the terminal and shell scripting.
