##This is a WIP draft.

This is a copy of my web-based CV. It's fully buzz-word compliant (html5, css3 responsive design).

A live version of this cv can be found at http://philingrey.com/cv/

Feel free to fork and use for your own cv, just down forget to change the details....

## Printing a pdf

The cv contains stylings for print, however trial and error has shown (at least on a mac) the best combination is firefox and print to pdf with "include background colors" checked (it's an advanced option in the print dialog) and "headers and footers" all set to "--blank--".

## License

This cv is licensed under an MIT license. Which basically means - do whatever you want with it!

## Browser Support

Works well in Firefox, Chrome and Safari. Opera mostly works - Skills popups are partial cutoff by multi-column, but the mobile view is fine.

IE - don't know yet, haven't dared to check!
