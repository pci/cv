##This is a WIP draft.

This is a copy of my web-based CV. It's fully buzz-word compliant (html5, css3 responsive design).

Feel free to fork and use for your own cv, just down forget to change the details....

## Printing a pdf

The cv contains stylings for print, however trial and error has shown (at least on a mac) the best combination is safari and print to pdf with "include backgrounds" checked (it's an advanced option in the print dialog) and "include headers and footers" unchecked.
